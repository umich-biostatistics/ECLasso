Description: An inplementation of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers in R.  Given data from 
    survival (Cox) certain GLMs (Gaussian, poisson, binomial), it can estimate parameters for each covariate.  It 
    includes options on whether to include an intercept effect, to solve exactly or use an inexact update
    in each iteration (which greatly speeds up computation time), or solve over a user-defined lambda sequence.
    At each iteration, it outputs the parameter estimates and the lambda at that iteration, as well as the
    solution path upon completion.
